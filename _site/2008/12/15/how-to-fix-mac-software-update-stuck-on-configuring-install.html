				<p>Apple recently released a <a href='http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3194'>10.5.6 update</a> to OS X. While I was downloading the new stuff using Software Update, my internet connection was interrupted. I relaunched Software Update and assumed it would continue downloading. It appeared to finish and then asked to reboot to complete the update process.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the update process got stuck on <em>Configuring Install</em> and just sat there indefinitely. After an unhealthy hard power reset, I tried again with no luck. It seems the interrupted download led to some incomplete files and was hanging the update process.</p>

<p>I was able to solve the problem by deleting the partially downloaded files, then re-downloading using Software Update. This time around, the update applied successfully, upgrading and patching my OS X installation.</p>

<p>Hopefully this post will help others experiencing the same problem. My initial Google search returned a lot of outdated results.</p>

<p>In summary: if you keep getting stuck on <em>Configuring Install</em> during an update, try deleting the files in <em>/Library/Updates/</em> and restarting the update process.</p>
