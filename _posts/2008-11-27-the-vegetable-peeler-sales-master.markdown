Thanks to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a>, I just discovered <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2006/05/grafter200605?printable=true&amp;currentPage=all">this article</a> published by Vanity Fair back in 2006. It's the story of a remarkable man who is <em>the best in the world</em> at what he does. It's an entertaining read, but what strikes me most is the passion this man has for his work. After being mentored by an older and wiser predecessor, Joe Ades went on to become wildly successful selling $5 vegetable peelers on the streets of New York.

It's stories like this that inspire me to discover and pursue that which I can be the best in the world at.
