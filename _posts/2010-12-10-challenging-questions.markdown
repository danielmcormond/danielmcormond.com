A friend recently emailed me a quote from <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a>'s essay on <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html">Good and Bad Procrastination</a>.

My favorite part is below:

<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>What are the most important problems in your field?</li>
	<li>Are you working on one of them?</li>
	<li>Why not?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

Or, in other words:

<blockquote>What's the best thing you could be working on, and why aren't you?</blockquote>

Tough questions that I don't have answers for. Yet.
