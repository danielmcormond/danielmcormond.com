This is an expanded view of the LS9 engine introduced with the 2009 Corvette. My desktop has been set to this for awhile- <strong>I love seeing all the parts laid out</strong>. It's like a glorified version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Technic">Lego Technic</a> sets I built as a kid. If this engine was sold as a kit including building instructions, that would be phenomenal.
