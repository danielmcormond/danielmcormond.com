As Michael Delaney (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McQueen">Steve McQueen</a>) says in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Mans_(film)">Le Mans</a>:
<blockquote>"A lot of people go through life doing things badly. Racingâ€™s important to men who do it well. When youâ€™re racing, it... itâ€™s life. Anything that happens before or after... is just waiting."</blockquote>
