Perhaps you've seen the album art meme floating around Facebook lately.. For some reason, I was motivated to try my hand. Here are the instructions:

<ol>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random</a>
The first random wikipedia article you get is the name of your band.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3">http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3</a>
The last four or five words of the very last quote of the page is the title of your first album.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days">http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days</a>
Third picture, no matter what it is, will be your album cover.</li>
</ol>

I wasn't thrilled with my random results, but here's what I threw together:

<a href="http://danielmcormond.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/lawn_tennis_assoc.jpg"><img src="http://danielmcormond.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/lawn_tennis_assoc.jpg" alt="Lawn Tennis Association" title="Lawn Tennis Association" width="600" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-258" /></a>
