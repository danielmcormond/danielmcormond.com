When doing web application development, there are many random applications I use somewhat infrequently. These apps don't quite warrant a space in my dock. Of course, they aren't readily accessible- it takes some digging through Finder windows to find them in my Application folder.

To resolve this, I recently installed a free little Mac application launcher called <a href="http://amarsagoo.info/namely/">Namely</a>. After a quick keyboard shortcut and the first few letters of the app name in an auto-complete box, a simple 'enter' keystroke launches your application.

Here's what I like- It <strong>only</strong> indexes applications, limiting it's auto-complete results to items in your Application folder. Additionally, you can customize the keyboard shortcut in Namely's preferences.

In the past, I've used Spotlight to launch apps, but disabled it after getting sick of all the crunching as it indexed my files. I've also tried the popular <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/?quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>, but didn't stick with that long enough to get past the learning curve.

I like Namely because it does one thing and one thing well. If you're a Mac user, check it out.
