I happened to catch this video over on Kevin Phan's site, <a href="http://runandexplode.wordpress.com/2011/05/16/neilyoungberg/">Run and Explode</a>.

<blockquote>Metal-fabricator Neil Youngberg never planned on taking over his grandfather's business and is now faced with passing on his legacy. 

In this short-form profile, VitaBrevisFilms interviews Neil Youngberg for the beginning exploration of our "Professional" series. Shot on location in Neil's metal fabrication shop, the 3rd generation craftsman gives a sincere overview of his life's work, dispensing hard-worn wisdom while illuminating the sobering realities of the role private business plays in an ever changing economic landscape. A deeply personal project for all involved, this on-going series seeks to shed-light on forgotten trades and practices in an evolving America.</blockquote>
