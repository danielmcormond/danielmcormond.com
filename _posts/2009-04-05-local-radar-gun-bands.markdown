Here's a mental list I've been compiling based on feedback from the <a href="http://valentine1.com/">V1</a>:

<ul>
	<li>NYS Trooper: <strong>Ka</strong> and <strong>Laser</strong></li>
	<li>Monroe County Sheriff: <strong>Ka</strong></li>
	<li>East Rochester Police: <strong>K</strong></li>
	<li>Greece Police: <strong>K</strong></li>
</ul>

Other than automatic door openers, I've never seen anyone using <strong>X</strong> band around here, so I disabled it.

Those programmable, transportable roadside construction signs use <strong>K</strong> band. I wonder if they are recording vehicle speed data as people drive by?
