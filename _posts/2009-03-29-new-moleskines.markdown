I've been a fan of <a href="http://www.moleskine.com/">Moleskine</a> notebooks for some time. Historically, I've used the small pocket sized hard cover notebook. The problem is, at only 3.5" wide my hand feels cramped for space and I have limited room for writing or drawing.

To remedy this, I recently migrated to some softcover <a href="http://www.moleskine.com/catalogue/classic/cahier/cardboard_black_cover/set_of_3_plain_cahier_journals__black__extra_large.php">extra large plain journals</a>. They're sized at 7.5"x10", so I have plenty of room for ideas now. They're also thinner, so they fit better in my bag. Additionally, the soft cover allows them to lay flat.
