After last year's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakar_Rally">Dakar Rally</a> was cancelled, it was exciting to see the race return this year with a new location: South America. <a href="http://jalopnik.com/">Jalopnik</a> recently published a gallery of race photos <a href="http://jalopnik.com/5135410/flying-across-the-desert-amazing-dakar-rally-photo-gallery">here</a>. I've got a lot of respect for the drivers and teams that compete in this race. Maybe I'm in the wrong industry, because I would love to participate in this event at some level.
